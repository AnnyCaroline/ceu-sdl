SDL binding for Céu:

https://github.com/fsantanna/ceu-sdl/

[SDL](http://www.libsdl.org/) provides basic input & output functionality
(e.g., timers, keyboard, mouse, display) and works in typical platforms (e.g.,
Windows, Mac, Linux, Android).

Céu is a reactive language that aims to offer a higher-level and safer 
alternative to C.
